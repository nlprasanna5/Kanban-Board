# Kanban Board Project :


 * The Kanban Board is a visual tool that helps to manage work efficiently and effectively by visualizing the workflow and providing a clear picture of the status of each task.

* This project is to create multiple boards for different courses and subjects, with columns representing different stages of a task's life cycle such as To Do, In Progress, and Done. The project will also include features such as drag and drop functionality to easily move tasks between columns, adding due dates and priority levels to each task, and the ability to assign tasks to specific team members or collaborators.

* In addition to the basic functionality, the project  also included customization options for each board, such as the ability to change the color of the board or add custom tags to tasks. The project will be designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for students to navigate and manage their tasks efficiently.

* Overall, the Kanban Board project using React will provide a powerful and flexible tool for students to manage their tasks and assignments effectively, helping them to stay organized and on top of their workload.


### **Here are the steps to get started with creating a Kanban Board project in React:** 


1. Define the Kanban Board layout: The Kanban Board layout typically consists of columns for different stages of a task's life cycle, such as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". You can use HTML and CSS to define the layout of your Kanban Board.

2. Create React components: In React, you can break down your UI into smaller reusable components. For example, you can create a "Card" component to represent a task, a "Column" component to represent a column on the board, and a "Board" component to represent the entire Kanban Board.

3. Implement drag and drop functionality: To allow users to move tasks between columns, you can use a drag and drop library such as React DnD or react-beautiful-dnd.

4. Manage the state of the application: In React, you can manage the state of your application using the "useState" hook or the "useReducer" hook. You can use the state to keep track of the tasks and their status on the board.

5. Add functionality for adding and editing tasks: You can add functionality to allow users to add new tasks to the board and edit existing tasks.

6. Implement customizations: You can allow users to customize the Kanban Board by adding features such as changing the color of the board or adding custom tags to tasks.

7. Test and deploy: Test your application thoroughly to ensure it's working as expected, and then deploy it to a hosting platform such as Netlify, Heroku, or GitHub Pages.
