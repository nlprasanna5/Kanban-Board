# Kanban Board Project :

- The Kanban Board is a visual tool that helps to manage work efficiently and effectively by visualizing the workflow and providing a clear picture of the status of each task

- This project is to create multiple boards for different courses and subjects, with columns representing different stages of a task's life cycle such as To Do, In Progress, and Done. The project will also include features such as drag and drop functionality to easily move tasks between columns, adding due dates and priority levels to each task, and the ability to assign tasks to specific team members or collaborators

- In addition to the basic functionality, the project also included customization options for each board, such as the ability to change the color of the board or add custom tags to tasks. The project will be designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for students to navigate and manage their tasks efficiently

- Overall, the Kanban Board project using React will provide a powerful and flexible tool for students to manage their tasks and assignments effectively, helping them to stay organized and on top of their workload.
